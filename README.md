# adventureFileNavigation
File generation and interface for a room navigation game.

Rooms.C generates a series of files to hold descriptions of in-game rooms and room connections. Adventure.C acts as a simple text interface for playing the game with most recently generated rooms/files to navigate from room to room to find the end room and complete the game.
